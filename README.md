### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a seeker by heart; my love for Indian mythology and Cricket and connecting them with real-life situations give an edge both on professional and personal fronts. A firm believer of right education and an ardent advocate of open source mentality. A great company to be with who will ensure that every conversation turns out to be as stimulating as a cup of hot coffee.
